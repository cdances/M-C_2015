abstract = {The method of modified equations is studied as a technique for the analysis of finite difference equations. The non-uniqueness of the modified equation of a difference method is stressed and three kinds of modified equations are introduced. The first modified or equivalent equation is the natural pseudo-differential operator associated to the original numerical method. Linear and nonlinear combinations of the equivalent equation and their derivatives yield the second modified or second equivalent equation and the third modified or (simply) modified equation, respectively. For linear problems with constant coefficients, the three kinds of modified equations are equivalent among them and to the original difference scheme. For nonlinear problems, the three kinds of modified equations are asymptotically equivalent in the sense that an asymptotic analysis of these equations with the time step as small parameter yields exactly the same results. In this paper, both regular and multiple scales asymptotic techniques are used for the analysis of the Euler forward difference method, and the resulting asymptotic expansions are verified for several nonlinear, autonomous, ordinary differential equations. It is shown that, when the resulting asymptotic expansion is uniformly valid, the asymptotic method yields very accurate results if the solution of the leading order equation is smooth and does not blow up, even for large step sizes.},

abstract = {Computational simulation can be defined as any computer application which involves the numerical solution to a system of partial differential equations. In this paper, a broad overview is given of verification procedures for computational simulation. The two aspects of verification examined are code verification and solution verification. Code verification is a set of procedures developed to find coding mistakes that affect the numerical discretization. The method of manufactured solutions combined with order of accuracy verification is recommended for code verification, and this procedure is described in detail. Solution verification is used to estimate the numerical errors that occur in every computational simulation. Both round-off and iterative convergence errors are discussed, and a posteriori methods for estimating the discretization error are examined. Emphasis is placed on discretization error estimation methods based on Richardson extrapolation as they are equally applicable to any numerical method. Additional topics covered include calculating the observed order of accuracy, error bands, and practical aspects of mesh refinement. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Verification and validation (V\&V) are the primary means to assess the accuracy and reliability of computational simulations. V\&V methods and procedures have fundamentally improved the credibility of simulations in several high-consequence fields, such as nuclear reactor safety, underground nuclear waste storage, and nuclear weapon safety. Although the terminology is not uniform across engineering disciplines, code verification deals with assessing the reliability of the software coding, and solution verification deals with assessing the numerical accuracy of the solution to a computational model. Validation addresses the physics modeling accuracy of a computational simulation by comparing the computational results with experimental data. Code verification benchmarks and validation benchmarks have been constructed for a number of years in every field of computational simulation. However, no comprehensive guidelines have been proposed for the construction and use of V\&V benchmarks. For example, the field of nuclear reactor safety has not focused on code verification benchmarks, but it has placed great emphasis on developing validation benchmarks. Many of these validation benchmarks are closely related to the operations of actual reactors at near-safety-critical conditions, as opposed to being more fundamental-physics benchmarks. This paper presents recommendations for the effective design and use of code verification benchmarks based on manufactured solutions, classical analytical solutions, and highly accurate numerical solutions. In addition, this paper presents recommendations for the design and use of validation benchmarks, highlighting the careful design of building-block experiments, the estimation of experimental measurement uncertainty for both inputs and outputs to the code, validation metrics, and the role of model calibration in validation. It is argued that the understanding of predictive capability of a computational model is built on the level of achievement in V\&V activities, how closely related the V\&V benchmarks are to the actual application of interest, and the quantification of uncertainties related to the application of interest. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The modeling of nuclear reactors involves the solution of a multiphysics problem with various time and length scales. Mathematically, this requires solving a system of coupled, nonlinear, stiff, Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). This paper deals with the verification aspects associated with a multiphysics code, i.e.; the substantiation that the mathematical description of the multiphysics equations are solved correctly (in time and space). Multiphysics applications have the added complexity that the solution field participates in various physics components, potentially yielding spatial and/or temporal coupling errors. We present a multiphysics framework that tightly couples the various physical models using the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov technique (JFNK) and show that high-order convergence can be achieved in both space and time.
